# Chime-Charmer

For my Physical Computing midterm I worked with Ahbinav Sircar in developing a physical windchime. Our initial idea was when a plant felt wind and its leaves moved that there would be some auditory reaction to that movement and a possible visual component. We decided the best way to achieve this would be using a series of methods we had learned in class. 

We used:

5 Piezo sensors
1 Home depot plant
p5 and html coding
1 arduino
5 sounds found online
p5 serial control

We attached the piezo sensors to leaves on the plant and programmed the arduino to record the sensor data when the leaf moved or experienced wind. Once this happened we let p5 serial control convert that data to be usable in p5. We had a visualization in which when wind struct a particular leaf/sensor a circle on screen (html) would get bigger while simultaneously playing a chime sound.

I personally wanted to have petals fall in accordance with movement but in the interest of time we scrapped this. The Petal Project shows what that could have looked like.
